\section{\textsc{Work Experience}}
\cventry{06/2014 -- Present}{Senior DevOps Engineer}{PlayFab, Inc.}
{Seattle, WA}{}{%
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Designed and built a scalable server management stack which featured
      built-in blue/green deployments, immutable server builds and aggregated,
      near-real-time analysis of server event and performance data. This
      allowed PlayFab engineers to easily build, test, deploy (and if needed,
      roll back) new versions of the company's core API services in time
      measured in minutes rather than hours. The management stack used Salt for
      scriptable deployment, Consul for service discovery and monitoring and
      Heka as an event stream router, with ElasticSearch and InfluxDB as data
      backends for log and metric aggregation respectively. As part of this
      effort, wrote code in Python, PowerShell, Lua, Go and Bash.
    \item Designed and ran a scalable and highly available infrastructure for
      API and multiplayer game server hosting services running Windows and
      Linux (CentOS) on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and SoftLayer Bare Metal
      cloud services. A happy side effect was an AWS cost reduction of 31% due
      to use of autoscaling groups and general efficiency improvements leading
      to a reduction in the number of servers live at any one time.
    \item Implemented continuous integration and testing services using Jenkins
      with automated deployments to Amazon Elastic Beanstalk environments.
    \item Redesigned and upgraded ejabberd infrastructure, which was used to
      provide game chat services. To allow autoscaling, wrote an ejabberdctl
      cluster join/leave module in Erlang to use as part of an AWS autoscaling
      process.
